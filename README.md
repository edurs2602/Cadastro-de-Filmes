# Kivy

Innovative user interfaces made easy.

Kivy is an open source, cross-platform Python framework for the development of applications that make use of innovative, multi-touch user interfaces. The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and rapid prototyping whilst making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python and Cython, based on OpenGL ES 2, supports various input devices and has an extensive widget library. With the same codebase, you can target Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. All Kivy widgets are built with multitouch support.

Kivy is MIT licensed, actively developed by a great community and is supported by many projects managed by the Kivy Organization.
